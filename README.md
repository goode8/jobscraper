# Web Scraper for Job Listings

## Indeed
This was so easy. 
I found a few ways to do it.
I print it to the screen and I decided I wanted it to print to a file. 
I just run from python in the command line. 

I was using the developer console (F12 on windows). 
I found chrome to be a little "nicer" than firefox to look at. I hope that's not too controversial. 
I also looked up how to use javascript. 

I did find a few sites seemed "harder" to find the data itself, like it was linked. I'll have to look at that more. 

## LinkedIn
:hatching_chick:
I went to the openAI chat and got these two scripts for LinkedIn. Not to be used for commercial purposes: 
  beautiful_soup.py
  selenium_scrape.py
