#Working on a web scraper for Indeed 

It's hard to believe how easy this was
I found a few ways to do it.
I print it to the screen and I decided I wanted it to print to a file. 
I just run from python in the command line. 

I was using the developer console (F12 on windows). 
I found chrome to be a little "nicer" than firefox to look at. I hope that's not too controversial. 
I also looked up how to use javascript. 

I did find a few sites seemed "harder" to find the data itself, like it was linked. I'll have to look at that more.
